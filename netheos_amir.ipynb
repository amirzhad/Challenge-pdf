    "* 1) Instead of reading the whole file, I read from the end of the file. I read until I reach the \"\\n\" or \"\\r\" to find the last line. This way is efficient, especially for large files.\n",
    "* 2) The *max_reading_bytes* defines the maximum number of character we will read from the end of the file. Each character can be from 1 to 4 bytes and I assumed that it is 1 (no difference in complexity of the method). If we read more than 30 bytes then it means that the last line does not contain \"%%EOF\" and we have to terminate the searching. This is done by checking the variable *sum_of_read_bytes*.\n",
    "* 3) At the end, I will read the line (which is the last line) and then I check if it contains \"%%EOF\" or not.\n",
    "* 4) Using the size of the file and the number of characters we read from the end, we can easily compute the offset (using *size_of_file* and *sum_of_read_bytes*)."
